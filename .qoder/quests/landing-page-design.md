# Landing Page Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a beautiful landing page that serves as the main entry point for the LookEscolar platform. The landing page will provide two distinct access paths:

1. **Admin Dashboard Access** - For photographers and administrators to manage school events, photos, and orders
2. **Customer Access** - For families to access their private photo galleries using a token or QR code

The design will follow Apple-grade UI standards with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a premium and accessible experience across all devices. This aligns with the existing design system that emphasizes liquid glass effects, sophisticated backdrop blur, and smooth animations.

## 2. Design Requirements

### 2.1 User Personas

- **Administrator/Photographer**: Professional users who need to upload photos, manage events, and process orders

## 4. Visual Design

### 4.1 Color Scheme

Following the existing design system from `lib/design-system/tokens.ts`:
- **Primary**: Professional blue (hsl(210, 100%, 60%)) from the primary color palette
- **Secondary**: Creative purple (hsl(268, 79%, 63%)) for complementary elements
- **Accent**: Premium gold (hsl(45, 93%, 47%)) for highlights and calls-to-action
- **Background**: Ultra-white with subtle gradients using the gradient-mesh class
- **Text**: High-contrast dark gray for readability following WCAG AAA standards

### 4.2 Typography

Using the established typography system:
- **Headings**: Inter font family with bold weights for impact
- **Body Text**: Inter font family with readable weights
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between heading levels with size and weight following the typography scale

### 4.3 Spacing and Layout

Following the 8pt grid system defined in the design tokens:
- Consistent spacing using the design system tokens from `lib/design-system/tokens.ts`
- Ample whitespace for visual breathing room with the liquid glass design principles
- Responsive breakpoints for all device sizes using Tailwind CSS

### 4.4 Components

Using existing design system components from the `components/ui/` directory:
- Glass cards with backdrop blur effects using the Card component variants
- Apple-grade buttons with hover animations using the Button component
- Responsive grid layouts using the layout-responsive components
- Accessible form elements for token entry with proper validation

## 5. User Flows

### 5.1 Administrator Access Flow

1. User lands on the landing page
2. Identifies the "Admin Dashboard" CTA
3. Clicks the CTA button
4. Redirected to login page if not authenticated (following existing `/login` route)
5. After authentication, directed to admin dashboard (`/admin` route)
6. Integration with existing Supabase authentication system

### 5.2 Customer Access Flow

1. User lands on the landing page
2. Scrolls to the "Access Your Gallery" section
3. Either:
   - Enters their token in the input field and submits
   - Clicks the QR code scanning option and scans their code
4. Directed to their private gallery page

## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Media queries for tablet and desktop breakpoints
- Touch-friendly target sizes (minimum 44px)

### 6.2 Performance Optimization

- Optimized image assets with multiple resolutions
- Code splitting for JavaScript bundles
- Server-side rendering for initial content
- Lazy loading for non-critical components

### 6.3 Accessibility
