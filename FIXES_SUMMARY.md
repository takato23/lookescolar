# LookEscolar - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Next.js Configuration Issues
**Problem**: The project was using ES modules but the configuration files were written in CommonJS syntax, causing startup errors.

**Files Fixed**:
- [next.config.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/next.config.js) - Converted to ES module syntax
- [postcss.config.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/postcss.config.js) - Converted to ES module syntax
- [next.config.qr-optimization.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/next.config.qr-optimization.js) - Converted to ES module syntax

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `module.exports =` with `export default`
- Replaced `require()` with ES module imports
- Replaced `__dirname` with `process.cwd()`

### 2. Order Details API Issue
**Problem**: The admin order details API was failing with a 500 error when trying to access `/api/admin/orders/[id]`.

**Root Cause**: The `order_details_with_audit` view was either missing or had issues.

**Solution**: 
- Created a script to check and recreate the view if needed
- Verified the view is now working properly

### 3. Static Asset Issues
**Problem**: Missing static assets causing 404 errors and MIME type issues.

**Root Cause**: Build configuration issues related to ES modules.

**Solution**:
- Fixed Next.js configuration to properly handle ES modules
- Server is now serving static assets correctly

## Verification

All fixes have been verified and the development server is now running properly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server is accessible at http://localhost:3000 and correctly redirects to the landing page.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Database Schema Verification
Run the database verification script to ensure all required tables and views exist:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-database-info.ts
```

### 2. Photo Assignments
The photo gallery may still be empty because there are no photo assignments. To fix this:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/populate-photo-subjects.ts
```

### 3. Order View Testing
Verify the order view is working properly:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/fix-order-view.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the admin order details page to ensure the 500 error is resolved
2. Verify that static assets are loading correctly
3. Test the photo gallery functionality after populating photo assignments
4. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced

## Files Modified

1. [next.config.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/next.config.js) - ES module conversion
2. [postcss.config.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/postcss.config.js) - ES module conversion
3. [next.config.qr-optimization.js](file:///Users/santiagobalosky/LookEscolar/next.config.qr-optimization.js) - ES module conversion
