# Proposed Improvements for LookEscolar

## Structural Improvements
- Organize lib/ into subfolders: auth, db, payments, utils.
- Use absolute imports consistently with @/* alias.

## Architectural Improvements
- Migrate API routes to edge runtime for better performance: Add { runtime: 'edge' } to exports in API files.
- Implement Redis caching for frequent queries.
- Add error monitoring with Sentry or similar.
- Use monorepo structure if expanding to mobile apps.

## Next Steps
- Review and prioritize based on needs.
