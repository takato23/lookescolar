# Security Implementation Guide - LookEscolar

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKLIST

### Pre-Production Security Verification

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] **Token Security**: ‚â•20 character tokens using crypto.randomBytes()
- [x] **Admin Authentication**: Real Supabase Auth (no development bypasses)
- [x] **Family Token Validation**: Server-side validation with expiration check

- [x] **Session Management**: Secure cookie handling with httpOnly, secure flags

#### Rate Limiting (Production Ready)
- [x] **Admin Photo Upload**: 10 req/min per IP
- [x] **Storage Signed URLs**: 60 req/min per token
- [x] **Family Gallery**: 30 req/min per token  
- [x] **Payment Webhook**: 100 req/min total
- [x] **Authentication**: 3 attempts/min per IP with 5-minute block
- [x] **General API**: 100 req/min per IP

    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -F "eventId=test" -F "files=@test.jpg"
done
# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after 10th request

# Test auth rate limiting (should block after 3 attempts/min)
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/auth \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"wrong@email.com","password":"wrong"}'
done
# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after 3rd attempt
```

```bash
# Test malicious file upload
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/photos/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "eventId=$EVENT_ID" \
  -F "files=@malicious.php"
# Expected: 400 File type not allowed

# Test oversized file
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/photos/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \

# Expected: 401 Invalid signature
```

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Log Analysis

Monitor these security events in production:

```bash
# Authentication failures
grep "auth_failed" /var/log/app.log | tail -20

# Rate limit violations  
grep "rate_limit_exceeded" /var/log/app.log | tail -20

# Suspicious activity
grep -E "(blocked_ip|suspicious_user_agent|hotlinking)" /var/log/app.log | tail -20

# Token security events
grep -E "(token_rotation|token_invalidated|invalid_token)" /var/log/app.log | tail -20
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check rate limiting effectiveness
grep "rate_limit" /var/log/app.log | \
  awk '{print $1}' | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Monitor upload security
grep "photo_upload" /var/log/app.log | \
  grep -E "(blocked|rejected|failed)" | wc -l

# Check webhook security
grep "webhook" /var/log/app.log | \
  grep -E "(invalid_signature|missing_headers)" | wc -l
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Incident Response

### Security Breach Response

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Rotate compromised tokens
   curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/security/tokens/rotate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"reason":"security_breach"}'

   # Block suspicious IPs at load balancer level
   # Review logs for breach indicators
   grep -A5 -B5 "suspicious_pattern" /var/log/app.log
   ```

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check authentication logs for unauthorized access
   - Review file upload logs for malicious files
   - Verify webhook signature logs for tampering attempts
   - Analyze rate limiting logs for abuse patterns

3. **Recovery**:
   - Invalidate affected tokens
   - Reset user sessions if needed
   - Update security rules if new vectors discovered
   - Communicate with affected users if necessary

### Token Rotation Procedures

```bash
# Emergency token rotation for all users
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/security/tokens/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_before_expiry":365,"reason":"emergency_rotation"}'

# Scheduled weekly rotation for expiring tokens
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/security/tokens/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_before_expiry":7,"reason":"scheduled_maintenance"}'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTE**: Never disable security features in production. If you need to temporarily adjust limits for legitimate use cases, do so through environment variables and monitor closely.

**üö® EMERGENCY CONTACT**: In case of security breach, immediately contact the development team and begin incident response procedures.
