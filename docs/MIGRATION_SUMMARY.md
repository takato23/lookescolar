## Migration Status

✅ **Completed**: All agent documentation converted to standardized formats
✅ **Completed**: New documentation structure created
✅ **Completed**: Main README updated with documentation references
✅ **Completed**: Historical files archived
✅ **Completed**: Critical files preserved as requested

## Next Steps

1. Review all new documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Update any internal references to old documentation paths
3. Establish documentation maintenance procedures
4. Train team members on new documentation structure
5. Set up automated documentation quality checks

## Notes

- All original agent files in the `agents/` directory can now be considered archived as their content has been consolidated into the new standardized documentation
- The `CLAUDE.md` file was specifically preserved as requested and is not part of the consolidation effort
- Historical documentation files were moved to the `docs/archive/` directory for preservation while keeping the main documentation clean and organized
