## Database Maintenance

### Index Maintenance
- Review and update database indexes based on query patterns
- Remove unused indexes to improve write performance
- Monitor index usage statistics

### Data Archiving
- Archive old events and photos to reduce database size
- Implement data retention policies
- Ensure archived data remains accessible when needed

### Statistics Updates
- Regularly update database statistics for query optimization
- Monitor query performance and adjust as needed

## Security Maintenance

### Token Rotation
```bash
# Emergency token rotation for all users
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/security/tokens/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_before_expiry":365,"reason":"emergency_rotation"}'

# Scheduled weekly rotation for expiring tokens
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/security/tokens/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_before_expiry":7,"reason":"scheduled_maintenance"}'
```

### Security Updates
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for used technologies
- Apply security patches promptly

## Performance Maintenance

### Cache Management
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust cache strategies
- Clear caches when deploying updates
- Review cache expiration policies

### Storage Cleanup
- Remove temporary files and logs regularly
- Clean up failed upload artifacts
- Monitor storage usage and plan for capacity

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - Failed login attempts per hour
   - Token rotation frequency  
   - Session timeout events

2. **Rate Limiting Effectiveness**:
   - Requests blocked per endpoint
   - Peak request volumes handled
   - Attack pattern detection

3. **File Upload Security**:
   - Malicious files blocked
   - File validation errors
   - Upload size violations

4. **Payment Security**:
   - Webhook signature failures
   - Payment fraud attempts
   - Response time compliance (<3s)

### Automated Alerts

Set up monitoring alerts for:
- Authentication failure rate >10/min
- Rate limit violations >100/min
- File upload rejections >50%
- Webhook signature failures >5%
- Response times >2s for webhooks

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Procedures
- Daily database backups
- Weekly full system backups
- Store backups in multiple geographic locations
- Test backup restoration regularly

### Recovery Procedures
- Documented disaster recovery plan
- Regular recovery testing
- Clear roles and responsibilities during recovery
- Communication plan for stakeholders

## Update Management

### Application Updates
- Test updates in staging environment first
- Deploy during low-traffic periods
- Monitor system after deployment
- Have rollback plan ready

### Dependency Updates
- Regular dependency audit
- Update dependencies with security fixes immediately
- Test all updates before applying to production
- Maintain list of critical dependencies

## Documentation Updates

### Keeping Documentation Current
- Update documentation with each significant change
- Review documentation quarterly for accuracy
- Ensure documentation matches actual system behavior
- Keep documentation versioned with code releases

## Change Management

### Change Approval Process
1. Document proposed changes
2. Assess impact and risks
3. Obtain approval from appropriate stakeholders
4. Schedule implementation
5. Test changes in staging
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor results
8. Document outcomes

### Emergency Changes
- Document emergency changes immediately after implementation
- Review emergency changes in next regular meeting
- Update procedures based on emergency change experiences
