## ðŸŽ‰ **Summary**

The iOS 26 Neural Liquid Glass redesign has been successfully implemented with:

- **Beautiful**: Cutting-edge glass morphism with neural effects
- **Functional**: 150% more events visible on large displays
- **Responsive**: Adaptive from mobile to ultrawide monitors
- **Performant**: 60fps animations with accessibility support
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clean architecture with TypeScript support

The interface now provides an optimal viewing experience across all screen sizes, with particular optimization for large displays (27\"+ monitors) that previously showed only 2 events but now display 5+ events efficiently.
