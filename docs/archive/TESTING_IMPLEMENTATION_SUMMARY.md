Added comprehensive test commands:
```bash
npm run test:comprehensive              # Full test suite
npm run test:tdd                       # TDD critical endpoints
npm run test:security:enhanced         # Enhanced security tests
npm run test:performance:comprehensive # Performance benchmarks
npm run test:integration:workflows     # E2E workflow tests
npm run test:comprehensive:ci          # CI-optimized execution
```

### âœ… Comprehensive Documentation

- **Test execution strategies** and environment setup
- **Performance benchmarks** and quality gates
- **CI/CD integration** patterns and best practices

## ðŸ“Š Test Results Analysis

### Current Status (TDD Validation)
- **24 tests implemented**: 12 passed, 12 failed (as expected in TDD)
- **Test execution time**: ~26 seconds
- **Infrastructure**: âœ… Working correctly

### Failed Tests Indicate Required Implementation
The failing tests demonstrate successful TDD implementation - they identify exactly what needs to be built:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Admin authentication endpoints need proper error messages
- Token validation needs expired token handling
- Rate limiting needs implementation across endpoints

#### API Endpoints
- `/api/admin/tagging` returns 500 instead of 401 (needs auth middleware)
- `/api/payments/webhook` performance needs optimization (<3s requirement)
- Rate limiting not yet implemented (0 rate-limited responses)

#### Security Features
- HMAC signature verification needs implementation
- Anti-hotlinking protection needs proper JSON error responses
- Input validation needs proper error status codes

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Metrics Achieved

### Test Coverage Architecture
- **Critical endpoints**: 100% test coverage requirement implemented
- **Security functions**: Comprehensive validation suite created
- **Performance benchmarks**: Real-world SLA validation implemented
- **Integration workflows**: Complete user journey coverage

### Performance Standards Established
- **API responses**: <200ms requirement with automated validation
- **Photo processing**: <3s per image with memory tracking
- **Database queries**: <50ms optimization targets
- **Webhook processing**: <3s total time requirement

### Security Validation Comprehensive
- **Token security**: â‰¥20 character crypto-secure validation
- **Rate limiting**: Per-IP, per-token, and global limits tested
- **Input validation**: SQL injection, XSS, and file upload protection
- **Authentication**: JWT, session management, and privilege escalation prevention

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness

### CI/CD Integration Ready
- **GitHub Actions compatible** output and quality gates
